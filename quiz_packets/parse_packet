""" This program parses, through stdin, a file containing multiple
choice questions and answers. Each question is expected to have four
possible answers, with the first question being the correct one. The
input file is expected to be in the following format: each question
and its answers are separated by a single line break, and new question
is preceded by two line breaks.

Question set format:
# topic
## subtopic
### subtopics
question
correct answer
answer
answer
answer

WARNING: Any question that is not followed by four non-whitespace-only
lines will be discarded. An error message will be sent to stderr with
the line number of the improperly formatted question set.
