\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to provide a projected cost analysis
of the quiz program known as SiQuoia. First, a description of SiQuoia
and the scope of the project will be presented. Next, assumptions made
by the project team will be included. Lastly, it will provide a
breakdown of the costs based on the item type and will include a cost
estimation (figures will be in USD) for each item, as well as a
detailed explanation on specific entities included in the item type
and contributing factors to the calculated cost. This document is
intended for the client at SiQuoia Inc.

\section{Project Description}
The software system known as SiQuoia is a simple quiz program with
problem sets consisting of one question and four answers with only one
correct answer. The program is designed to increase intelligence
quotient in users, provide training and certification processes. Each
question will have a difficulty ranking based on the average number of
tries it takes to answer the question correctly.

The system will have a web browser interface in which users can log in
and view any of their unfinished quizzes or start a new quiz, see
their stats and achievements, or submit new questions. The user can
also claim rewards such as memorabilia or other question sets and
refer new users to join.

The web interface will interact with a database to keep track of user
and game information.
