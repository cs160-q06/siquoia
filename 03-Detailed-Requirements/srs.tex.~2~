\section{Project Description}
The software system SiQuoia provides a quiz program with problem sets
consisting of questions that each have four possible answers, only one
which is correct. The program is designed to increase the intelligence
quotient of users, to provide training, and to be used in
certification processes. The difficulty of each question will be
ranked according to the frequency that users answer the question
correctly or incorrectly.

The system will have a web browser interface through which users can
log in and view an unfinished quiz or start a new quiz. Users can view
their quiz scores, submit new questions, and claim rewards such as
memorabilia or other question sets. Users can earn points by referring
new users to join.

The web interface is connected to a MariaDB database through an
underlying Java application stack. The database keeps track of user
and quiz game information.

\section{Scope}

\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Members of the project team all have a computer (laptop or
  desktop) to access SiQuoia and do not need to purchase any
  additional hardware for this project.
\item All project team members have access to Internet throughout
  the duration of the SiQuoia project.
\item SiQuoia does not need to be hosted on the Internet. The server 
  stack can be set up locally on any desktop or laptop computer.
\item There are no specific tools that must be used in this
  project. The project team is not restricted when choosing the tools
  that will be used.
\item No proprietary software will be used by the project team.
\item No licensing will be required.
\item Preparation for the project (requirements gathering) will begin
  September 2013.
\item The estimated period for contract is October 2013 to December
  2013, or approximately 10 weeks.
\item The duration of the project begins during preparation and
  culminates when the contract period expires.
\item Each project team member will be paid \$12.00 per hour of work.
\item All team members will be involved with the design and
  development of SiQuoia.
\item During the design and development phases of the project, team
  members will work 2.5 hours (150 minutes) per work day, totaling
  12.5 hours (750 minutes) per week each.
\item The estimated periods for design and development phases are 3
  weeks each.
\item Testing SiQuoia code will occur after each iteration of the
  project. There will be 3 iterations, occurring at the end of each
  week of development for approximately 2 hours.
\item Designing the SiQuoia homepage/login screen and logo will take
  approximately 3 hours.
\item Throughout the duration of the project, each team member will
  use approximately \$5.00 worth of gas per week for travel.
\item Something about risks/delays of project
\end{itemize}
