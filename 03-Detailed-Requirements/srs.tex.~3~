\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of
the quiz program known as \gls{SiQuoia}. It will provide detailed
descriptions of what this application will do, including functions
and features of the program, interfaces, and constraints under which
the program will operate. This document is intended for stakeholders
at SiQuoia, Inc., known hereafter as \gls{SeQuoia}.

\subsection{Scope}
The software system known as SiQuoia includes a simple quiz program
with packages consisting of one question and four answers, with only
one answer being correct. The program is designed to increase the
intelligence quotients of users or provide training or help in
certification processes. Each question will have a rank based on the
number of times it is answered correctly.

The system will have a web browser interface in which \glspl{user}
play as a guest or registered user. If registered, the system will
allow users to log in, resume their most recently unfinished quiz (if
such a quiz exists), select a game mode and begin a new quiz, view and
publish their progress analysis, and submit new quiz questions. The
system will also allow registered users to claim rewards in the game
store using cash or SiQuoia points and refer new users.

The web interface will interact with a database to keep track of user
and game information.
